# CS 262 - Homework 1

This homework exercise is based on [CS 262 Homework 1](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/03management/homework.html), which is further based on NetNinja's [Todo application](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) (lessons 9-15).

Homework 1's app functions as a todo list, whereby the user can add and remove items to do. It implements alerts, keyboard dismissal, and flexboxes for a clean application interface.
