# birthdayButton

birthdayButton takes a name and outputs the current age. This age is updated via a button, that when pressed, increments the age and appends an element containing the age to a list.

## Questions

1. There are multiple components in this application: the App() function acts as the main component, while View, Text, FlatList, etc. are all child components that act within the App() function.

2. Prop: *key* from each object element in the *birthdays* list; State: [name, setName]

3. Curly braces are used in XML/HTML set apart the content within them as JavaScript, indicating that the content is a JavaScript variable or reference.

4. One anonymous function is pressHandler, the function that is called when the button is pressed.

5. In the traditional sense, no, the application does not use HTML and/or CSS. The main component driving the app is JavaScript, with HTML and/or CSS being returned by JavaScript functions. While webpages are written in with JavaScript embedded in HTML files, JSX enables the insertion of HTML in JavaScript files.
