# CS 262 - Lab 4

This lab is based on [CS 262 Lab 4](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/04analysis/lab.html), which is based on NetNinja's 
[Reviews application](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) (videos #16-23).

Lab 4's app implements basic navigation between two pages: Home and ReviewDetails. Touchable components in the Home screen navigate to the ReviewDetails screen, which displays information based on which component was tapped.

Getting this code to run required:
- Do the upgrades specified in lab 1.
- Upgrading to ReactNavigation 5 (see <https://reactnavigation.org/docs/upgrading-from-4.x/>).
