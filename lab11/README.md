# CS 262 - Lab 11

This lab is based on [CS 262 Lab 11](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/11quality/lab.html).

# Markdown Formatting of Code Review

Modules checked:

**App.js**
- "Freespace," "nunito," and "Nunito" were labeled as typos.

**home.js**

-"Knollcrest," "Uppercrust," "Peet" were labeled as typos.

**about.js**
- Names of teammates were labeled as typos.

**map.js**
- "redmarker", "bluemarker," etc. are labeled as typos.

**global.js**
- "nunito" was labeled as a typo.


*Changes made:*

- **map.js**: Changed "redmarker" to "redMarker" to meet lowerCamelCase standards

- **report.js**: Changed local variable declaration from "var" to "let" (based on Google Javascript Style)

- Deleted Stylesheet import from several files, since it was not being used in them

*Changes I chose not to make:*

Did not change typos where the names were names of location, people, or fonts (i.e. "Freespace," "Uppercrust," or "nunito"), since their spelling was correct (just not in the dictionary sense).

*Notes:*

- I used VS Code to check whether or not certain libaries were being used

- I used Intellij Community to re-format the code and perform the code analysis (my analysis only brought up typos so I'm not sure if there were other bugs/errors it couldn't detect)
