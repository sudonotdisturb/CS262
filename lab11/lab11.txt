Modules checked:

Changes made:

	- map.js: Changed "redmarker" to "redMarker" to meet lowerCamelCase standards
	- report.js: Changed local variable declaration from "var" to "let" (based on Google Javascript Style)

Changes I chose not to make:

	- Typos where the names were names of location, people, or fonts (i.e. "Freespace," "Uppercrust," or "nunito")
