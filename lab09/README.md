# CS 262 - Lab 9

This is a data service application based on the [CS 262 sample Monopoly project](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project). It is deployed here:

[Monopoly data service](https://glacial-hollows-78987.herokuapp.com/)

Screenshots showing the data in the database can be found here:

In general, the application is based on the standard Heroku with Node.js tutorial.

The database is relational with the schema specified in the `sql/` sub-directory,
 and is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). The database user
and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables rather than in this (public) repo.
