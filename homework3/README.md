# CS 262 - Homework 3

This lab is based on [CS 262 Homework 3](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/09is/homework.html).

Homework 3's app expands upon [Homework 2's](https://github.com/sudonotdisturb/CS262/tree/master/homework2) application and fetches and displays data from the CS-262 [data service](https://github.com/sudonotdisturb/CS262-Service).

The service is deployed here: <https://cs262-service.herokuapp.com/>

```

```

2. Which of these endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?

3. Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.

4. Is there any evidence in your implementation of an impedance mismatch?
