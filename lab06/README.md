# CS 262 - Lab 5

This lab is based on [CS 262 Lab 6](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/06hci/lab.html), which is based on the "Fetch Example" from React Native's
[Networking tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/network).

Lab 6's app reads books data from the GoogleBooks API on Jane Austen novels and displays a a list of the first 10 results. Each list item contains the book title, thumbnail, author, and ISBN-13 number.
